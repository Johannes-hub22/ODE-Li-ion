# ODE-Li-ion

This project uses ODE to simulate electrochemical behaviour inside a Li-ion battery. The work is based on two papers from Daigle et al. (2013) and  Nascimento et al. (2021). 

The raw data is taken from the NASA battery database.

The current code (10/11/2022) however, is not able to successfully recreate the ODE models used in the first section of the respective papers.
